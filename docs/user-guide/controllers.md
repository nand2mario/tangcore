# Game Controllers

TangCore supports several types of game controllers including Dualshock 2 (DS2), USB HID, and USB Xinput devices. Controller compatibility will continue to improve with future updates. 

Instructions for USB controllers,

* To connect the SNES-style USB controllers sold by Sipeed with Tang Console, you can plug them into the bottom two USA-A ports of the board. These two ports are connected to the FPGA, and currently the FPGA only supports this model of USB gamepad directly.
* **For other USB controllers, you need a USB hub** with at least 3 ports - one for the USB drive and two for controllers. The hub also needs to support "power passthrough", so it provides power to the board. Here is [a list of working USB hubs](https://github.com/nand2mario/tangcore/wiki/Compatible-USB-Hubs). The hub should be plugged into the bottom-left USB-C port of the board, i.e. connecting to the BL616 MCU.

Here are some test results for controllers.

| Controller | Status | Photo |
|-----|-----|-----|
| DualShock 2 or compatible | ✅ Fully working (requires DS2 PMOD adapter) | ![](gamepad_ds2.jpg){: style="width:150px"} |
| Sipeed SNES-style USB Controller | ✅ Fully working | ![](gamepad_snes.jpg){: style="width:150px"} |
| 8BitDo SN30 Pro Wired Controller | ✅ Fully working (USB hub needed) | ![](gamepad_sn30pro.jpg){: style="width:150px"} |
| 8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter | ✅ Fully working (USB hub needed) | ![](gamepad_8bitdo_adapter.jpg){: style="width:150px"} |

My personal favorite is the 8BitDo wireless adapter paired with an 8BitDo Pro 2 controller. It offers excellent button layout, reliable wireless connectivity, and minimal input lag. Please note that each adapter can only pair with one controller, so you'll need two adapters for two-player gaming.
